/**
 * Base class for operators that invoke a system call, but do not emit their output to standard out. Unlike
 * PipedCommandOp, these operators don't need any fancy tricks to capture the output - it's just written to
 * a file by the command that we call (for instance, in GaTK the result is always written to a file). Hence
 * these operators do not need to capture the output stream, and just simply invoke a system call and wait for
 * it to complete.
